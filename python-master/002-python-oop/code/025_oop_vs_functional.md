# Object Oriented Programming Vs Functional Programming
* Here we demonstrate why Object Oriented Programming is more efficient than 
  Functional Programming for a same problem-solution

## Create a Class
* Here we create a Class to Add and Multiply TWO Numbers
```python
class oop_calc:

    n1 = None
    n2 = None
            
    def add1(self):
        return self.n1 + self.n2

    def mul1(self):
        return self.n1 * self.n2
```
## Create the Class Object
* Here we create the class object and display the size of the object
```python
from oop_calc import oop_calc

# session f1
f1 = oop_calc()
f1.n1 = 100
f1.n2 = 200
print(f1.add1())
print(f1.mul1())

# session f2
f2 = oop_calc()
f2.n1 = 1000
f2.n2 = 2000
print(f2.add1())
print(f2.mul1())

print(f1.__sizeof__() + f2.__sizeof__())

```
## Create a functional code the same as Class
* Here we create a file with functional code, same as the Test Class to Add 
  and Multiply TWO Numbers.
```python
n1 = None
n2 = None
        
def add1():
    return n1 + n2

def mul1():
    return n1 * n2
```

## Import Functionl Code File
* Here we import the Functionl Code File and assign the same values as in 
  the Object Oriented Programming.
* After assigning the values to the functional code caller, it proves that 
  the functionl code occupies more space, and proves that Object Oriented is 
  space efficient in similar business contexts.
```python
import func_test as f1
import func_test as f2

f1.n1 = 100
f1.n2 = 200

f2.n1 = 1000
f2.n2 = 2000

print(f1.__sizeof__() + f2.__sizeof__())
```
