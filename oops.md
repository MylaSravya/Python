## 1) Why are OOPs actively used in today’s world?

The OOP model is actively used for several reasons. The main reasons include:

* The model has proven extremely useful in building large-scale software applications and programs, especially those used in manufacturing, banking, and telecommunication.  
* The model makes it easy to manage and modify code at various stages of the software production process.
* OOPs have the feature of data hiding, allowing developers to secure data and information better.

## 2) Which are the major Object-Oriented Programming Languages?

The most popular OOP languages are:

* Python
* Java
* C#
* Ruby
* Perl
* Scala
  
## 3) What do you understand about a programming paradigm? What are the fundamental types of programming paradigms that are used?

Programming paradigms are a method to classify programming languages based on their core features. The two main programming paradigms include:

* Imperative Programming Paradigm
* Declarative Programming Paradigm
  
OOPs is a type of Imperative Programming Paradigm.

## 4) What are the main features of Object-Oriented Programming?

The main features of OOPs include:

* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Data Abstraction
* Polymorphism

## 5) What do you understand about an Object in OOPs?

This is a popular OOPs interview question asked at tech interviews. An Object is a basic entity in the OOP model and can take any definition. An object, based on its definition, can assume different states or behaviors.

## 6) What do you understand about a Class in OOPs?

A class is a collection of objects of different states/behaviors. Classes define the nature of an Object and future Objects and are the logical entities of an OOP model.

## 7) Explain the fundamental difference between a Class and a Structure.

This again is one of the more popular OOPs Interview Questions asked at tech interviews at FAANG and Tier-1 companies.

A class is essentially a collection of objects and contains instructions on the different actions on the Objects.

On the other hand, a structure contains a list of variables that can be of different data types to be used in the designing of a software model.

## 8) What are the building blocks of the Object-Oriented Programming Model?

The fundamental building blocks of the OOP model are:

* Classes
* Objects
* Methods
* Attributes

## 9) What is a Method in the OOP model?

Methods are essential functions inside a class and define the behavior of the Objects in a class. Methods are one of the fundamental building blocks of the Object-Oriented Programming Model.

## 10) What do you understand by Encapsulation in OOP?

Encapsulation is a primary feature of the OOP model and is a method that is used to capture all the required data and information in a capsule to hand out to the user. Only the required details are visible to the user, and all other details that aren’t relevant to the user are hidden through Encapsulation.

## 11) What do you understand by Polymorphism in OOP?

This is a popular Java OOPs interview question asked at technical interviews. Polymorphism is a process by which a given object, method, or code snippet is made to behave differently under different circumstances.

## 12) What are the two types of polymorphism in the OOP model?

The two types of Polymorphism are - Compile Time Polymorphism and Runtime Polymorphism.

Compile Time Polymorphism: The process of Polymorphism, when it occurs during compile time, is known as Compile Time Polymorphism. This essentially means that the compiler decides what value or shape an Object takes in a program.

Runtime Polymorphism: When Polymorphism occurs at Runtime, the process is known as Runtime Polymorphism.

## 13) What is Inheritance in OOP?

Inheritance is a feature in the OOP model that allows a Class to inherit the characteristics of another Class or a group of Classes.

## 14) What are the different types of Inheritance in OOP?

The different types of Inheritance in OOP are:

* Single Inheritance
* Multiple Inheritance
* Multilevel Inheritance
* Hierarchical Inheritance
* Hybrid Inheritance

## 15) What is Abstraction in OOPs? What are the two methods by which data Abstraction can be achieved?

Abstraction is a fundamental feature of OOP in which the implementation details are hidden, and only the necessary details are displayed. Abstraction can be achieved in two main ways:

Abstract Class and Abstract Method.

## 16) What is the fundamental difference between Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance in OOP?

In Multiple Inheritance, a class can inherit the characteristics or features of one or more base classes.

In Multilevel Inheritance, a class inherits the characteristics of another class, which in itself is a subclass of a given base class.

## 17) What do you understand about Hybrid Inheritance?

Hybrid Inheritance is essentially a combination of Multiple and Multilevel Inheritance. In this form of inheritance, a class can display characteristics of multiple inheritance or Multilevel inheritance, or both.

## 18) What are some limitations of the Inheritance feature of the OOP model?

Some limitations of Inheritance include:

* There’s a lot of jumping back and forth between classes in Inheritance. This increases the time required to execute the program. 
* If the program needs to be modified, both the Parent and Child classes need to be modified.
* The parent and child classes get coupled tightly and do not exhibit independent characteristics.

## 19) What are Superclasses and Subclasses in OOP?

A Superclass is a base class that lends characteristics and behaves as a Parent to other Classes. A Subclass is a type of class that inherits the attributes of another class.

## 20) What are Constructors and Destructors?

Constructors and Destructors are special Methods in OOP. A Constructor initializes an Object and also provides memory space for the Object.

A Destructor is when an Object is destroyed and clears the memory and other resources associated with an Object.

We hope this article on top OOPs interview questions will help prepare for coding interviews at tech companies. Practice such questions as much as possible to nail your technical interview.

## 21) What are some important OOP concepts asked in tech interviews at FAANG+ companies?

The important concepts in OOP that feature in technical interviews at FAANG+ companies include - Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Methods, Objects, and Data Abstraction. 

## 22) Will OOPs interview questions involve writing code in technical interviews?

Yes, you would have to write error-free code to explain certain concepts in OOP during technical interviews. As such, coding up algorithms in technical interviews requires a stronghold in OOPs concepts.

## 23) What are some advantages of using the Object-Oriented Programming Model?

The biggest advantage of using the OOP model is that it enables developers to design large-scale software programs. It is also loaded with many potent features that allow developers to create and design a wide range of software programs and applications.

## 24) Can OOPs Interview Questions in tech interviews be language-based?

Yes, in tech interviews at FAANG+ companies, you can be asked OOPs concepts interview questions, Java OOPs interview questions, Python OOPs interview questions, and C++ OOPs interview questions.

## 25) Are OOPs concepts important to solve problems in Data Structures and Algorithms?

Yes, having a solid grasp of OOPs concepts is key to solving tricky data structures and algorithms problems. Your extent of knowledge in OOPs also defines how good of a problem-solver you are, and problem-solving is the primary skill that is tested in tech interviews at FAANG+ companies.

## 26) What is method overloading in OOP or Java?
It's one of the oldest OOPS concept questions, I have seen it 10 years ago and still see it now. When we have multiple methods with the same name but different functionality then it's called method overloading. For example. System.out.println() is overloaded as we have a 6 or 7 println() method each accepting a different type of parameter.

## 27) What is the method overriding in OOP or Java?
It's one of the magic of object-oriented programming where the method is chosen based upon an object at runtime. In order for method overriding, we need Inheritance and Polymorphism, as we need a method with the same signature in both superclass and subclass. A call to such a method is resolved at runtime depending upon the actual object and not the type o variable. See the answer for a more detailed discussion.

## 28)What is the method of hiding in Java?
When you declare two static methods with the same name and signature in both superclass and subclass then they hide each other i.e. a call to the method in the subclass will call the static method declared in that class and a call to the same method is superclass is resolved to the static method declared in the super-class.

## 29) The difference between method overloading and overriding?
Several differences but the most important one is that method overloading is resolved at compile-time and method overriding is resolved at runtime. The compiler only used the class information for method overloading, but it needs to know the object to resolved overridden method calls.

## 30) Can we overload a static method in Java?
Yes, you can overload a static method in Java. You can declare as many static methods of the same name as you wish provided all of them have different method signatures.

## 31) Can we override the static method in Java?
No, you cannot override a static method because it's not bounded to an object. Instead, static methods belong to a class and are resolved at compile time using the type of reference variable. But, Yes, you can declare the same static method in a subclass, which will result in method hiding i.e. if you use the reference variable of type subclass then the new method will be called, but if you use the reference variable of superclass then the old method will be called.

## 32) Can we prevent overriding a method without using the final modifier?
Yes, you can prevent the method overriding in Java without using the final modifier. In fact, there are several ways to accomplish it e.g. you can mark the method as private or static, those cannot be overridden.

## 33) Can we override a private method in Java?
No, you cannot. Since the private method is only accessible and visible inside the class they are declared, it's not possible to override them in subclasses. Though, you can override them inside the inner class as they are accessible there.

## 34) What is the covariant method overriding in Java?
In the covariant method overriding, the overriding method can return the subclass of the object returned by the original or overridden method. This concept was introduced in Java 1.5 (Tiger) version and it's very helpful in case the original method is returning a general type like Object class, because, then by using the covariant method overriding you can return a more suitable object and prevent client-side typecasting. One of the practical use of this concept is when you override the clone() method in Java.

## 35) Can we have a non-abstract method inside an interface?
From Java 8 onward you can have a non-abstract method inside the interface, prior to that it was not allowed as all method was implicitly public abstract. From JDK 8, you can add static and default methods inside an interface.

## 36) What is an abstract class in Java?
An abstract class is a class that is incomplete. You cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Java. They are provided to define default behavior and ensured that client of that class should adore to those contract which is defined inside the abstract class. In order to use it, you must extend and implement their abstract methods. BTW, in Java, a class can be abstract without specifying any abstract method.

## 37) What are Manipulators?
Manipulators are the functions which can be used in conjunction with the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on an object. Examples are endl and setw.

## 38) Describe two differences between procedural programming and OOP
"The main difference between procedural programming and object-oriented programming is the basis of the language each program uses. Procedural programming uses function-based language, while object-oriented programming uses language based on real-world objects."

## 39) What limitations does OOP have?
"It’s important to be aware of the limitations of OOP before programming something new. OOP isn’t generally ideal for small problems, but it’s great for large projects. It also takes a lot of upfront planning to make sure everything works correctly once coded. For this reason, it can take longer to do than procedural programming."

## 40) Explain the differences between classes and objects
"A class is an object's template. An object is an instance of class. Objects hold information, but classes do not."

## 41) What is polymorphism and how is it supported in the coding language of your choice?
"Polymorphism can take a few different forms, but generally, it means that an object, code or operation behaves differently in different settings. C++ supports compiler time polymorphism and run time polymorphism. Compiler time polymorphism is when the compiler knows which function to use when making a polymorphic call. Run time polymorphism is when virtual functions are called by type of object referenced."

## 42) What are the benefits of OOP?
"There are many benefits to using OOP over other programming styles. For your company, two of the major benefits would be the simplicity of the programming and the ease of modification. OOP is simpler than other styles of programming because the objects within the program are modeled on real-world objects. The structure of the program is clear. OOP is easy to modify because the objects are maintained independently."
